# 🍉 Token Melon (T-Me)

**T-Me (Token Melon)** is a research organization focusing on  
**Unified Tokenization • Multimodal Understanding • Generation • Editing**.

We explore the next generation of multimodal AI — from efficient tokenizers to large-scale world models capable of consistent reasoning, action control, and content generation.

## 🍉 Our Research Themes

### 🔹 1. Unified Multimodal Tokenization  
Designing SelfTok-style universal tokenization frameworks for vision, language, video, and action spaces.

### 🔹 2. Multimodal Generation & Editing  
High-fidelity **image/video generation**, interleaved editing, and long-horizon storytelling.

### 🔹 3. World-Model Learning  
Memory consistency, action grounding, and inference-time scaling for agents.

### 🔹 4. Efficient Deployment  
Lightweight and scalable architectures for edge devices and real-time generation.
