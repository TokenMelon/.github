# 🍉 T-Me: Token Melon  
Building Intelligent Tokenization & Multimodal Generation Systems.

## 🔥 About Us
T-Me focuses on next-generation tokenization frameworks, multimodal understanding & generation, and world-model-based editing.
Founded in 2025, T-Me (Token Melon) is a research team advancing next-generation multimodal intelligence through **unified models**, **unified tokenization**, and **world-model** research. We explore multimodal understanding, generation, memory, and agentic reasoning, aiming to push the boundaries of scalable, general-purpose AI. With a long-term vision and global collaborations, T-Me is committed to impactful, foundational research.

## 🚀 Projects
- **T-Me** – A unified tokenization framework
- **WEAVE** – [Interleaved multimodal story & editing dataset](https://weichow23.github.io/weave/): The first benchmark suite for interleaved multimodal understanding and generation, providing large-scale datasets and evaluation protocols for multi-turn image reasoning, editing, and creation.

## 🍉 Our Vision
Make multimodal generation more controllable, efficient, and beautiful.
